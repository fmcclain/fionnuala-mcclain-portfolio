## Featured Projects

### Battle Boats – Autonomous Vehicle Project
Collaborated in a 3-person team to design and build an autonomous boat capable of navigating an unknown obstacle course.

Key contributions include:
- Designing structural components and waterproof housings using CAD software
- Building and assembling the boat using a mix of CAD-designed parts and off-the-shelf components
- Conducting physical pool testing to identify mechanical and integration issues
- Troubleshooting the design to improve performance

Our team successfully navigated multiple segments of the obstacle course, one of only three teams to do so out of twelve.

### Transcrib8r – AI-Powered Study Tool
Identified a common challenge faced by students: efficiently transcribing audio lectures and creating organized study materials. Our team designed and developed Transcrib8r, an AI-powered tool to address this problem.

Key contributions include:
- Building backend routes using Python and Flask
- Integrating transcription and generative AI APIs
- Maintaining and iterating on a shared Git codebase
- Coordinating feature development and debugging within the team

Presented the project in front of a panel of judges and professors, earning the Most Innovative Award.
