## Battle Boats – Autonomous Vehicle Project

### Overview
Battle Boats was a team-based project where I collaborated with two other students to design and build an autonomous boat capable of navigating an unknown obstacle course.

### My Role
Mechanical design, fabrication, and troubleshooting in close collaboration with software and electrical engineering teammates

### Contributions
- Designed structural components and waterproof electronics housing using CAD (Onshape)
- Supported hull design decisions through buoyancy and weight distribution analysis
- Assembled the boat, addressing fit, sealing, and stability issues
- Troubleshot mechanical and integration failures during on-water testing
- Iterated designs based on observed failure modes and performance results

### Tools & Skills
CAD, prototyping, fabrication, physical testing and troubleshooting, cross-disciplinary collaboration, autonomous vehicle systems
